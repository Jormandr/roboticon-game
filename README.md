This is team [Jormandr](https://jormandr.co.uk)'s implementation of the 'Roboticon Colony of York' project for 2016/17 SEPR of the [University of York](http://cs.york.ac.uk)'s Computer Science course. The game is a turn-based strategy game which might be considered either management or territorial control (think Civ) and is written in Java with LibGDX
